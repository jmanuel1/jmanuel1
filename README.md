## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

![header](header.build.svg)

I'm a software developer at Imagine Learning and a recent graduate of Arizona State University. I studied computer science and was an officer of the [Software Developers Association](https://thesoda.io). I like using code to create, and I believe in technology's ability to help us *do good things*. Outside of coding, I like games such as Thomas Was Alone and Cities: Skylines, [occasionally taking photos](https://unsplash.com/@photo_jam), math, and outer space.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [transpiled concatenative language called Concat](https://github.com/jmanuel1/concat). Check out my [Mailspring plugin, Todoer](https://github.com/jmanuel1/todoer), too.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming language design & implementation (at least, what I need to know for Concat).
- ðŸ‘¯ If you want to contribute to any of my projects, I encourage you to look at Concat and Todoer.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Concat's type checker and exploring computational sustainability.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development, programming languages, computational sustainability, Doctor Who lore, and my favorite Snarky Puppy tracks.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Once upon a time, I was on an ultimate frisbee team.
