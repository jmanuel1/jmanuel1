## Hello there 👋

I'm a rising junior at Arizona State University studying computer science. I'm an officer of the [Software Developers Association](https://thesoda.io). I like using code to create, and I believe in technology's ability to *do good things*. Outside of coding, I like games such as Thomas Was Alone and Civilization VI, [occasionally taking photos](https://unsplash.com/@photo_jam), math, and outer space.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [transpiled concatenative language called Concat](https://github.com/jmanuel1/concat). [See updates on my progress!](https://twitter.com/JasonAManuel) Check out my [Mailspring plugin, Todoer](https://github.com/jmanuel1/todoer), too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming language design & implementation (at least, what I need to know for Concat). I'm about to start reading [**Designing Data-Intensive Applications**](https://dataintensive.net) as part of a [Summer of Shipping](https://summerofshipping.com) reading group.
- 👯 If you want to contribute to any of my projects, I encourage you to look at Concat and Todoer.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Concat's type checker and exploring computational sustainability.
- 💬 Ask me about web development, programming languages, computational sustainability, Doctor Who lore, and my favorite Snarky Puppy tracks.
